# Linear Algebra

Arabic word Algebra(Al-jabr) => reunion of broken parts or symbols, 
while 
Latin word Calculus => small pebble/unit

(may be that first small pebbels are learnt first and then reuniting them !? But started off with Algebra as it is brush up of what is already known.)

After learning today's class on Algebra, I can put it upside down and present Algebra(reunion of parts) of a System ( a mathematical definition of a physical system) as below:

Any system can be presented in its mathematical form involving the parameters and the scaling factors that define the system behaviour.

                           System- defined by- Mathematical Equation(s) ax+by = cz
                                                 ^
                                                 |
                                                 |
                                 in its matrix form [ a b ][x] = [c] [z]
                                                                  [y] 
                                                 ^
                                                 |
                                                 |
                  defined in vectors [a b] or [c] representing the vector notation in space   
                                                 ^
                                                 |
                                                 |
 system parameters/scaling factors a/b/c being the point in space or position of the system w.r.t the parameter in space 

 
 To put it in words, the minute part of a system is a parameter/variable that defines the behaviour of a system, by tuning which with a scaling factor, varies the system behaviour. This minute part when positioned in space of vectors (that define the system), gives a vector of that parameter. Scaling this Vector/Parameter varies the behaviour of system , also defined within the space of system. Say, System output/behaviour is impacted by parameter1, then a change in parameter1 will change the output vector/ behaviour of system. Since a system is defined by many such parameters, the Al-jabr of all these vectors of Parameters constitue the system.
 
 What we study in Algebra is the answers to the following (and more) questions :
 1. How the vectors are presented in space? 
 2. The basis of a co-ordinate system for ref?
 3. What it means to scalar multiply a Vector, its behaviour?
 4. What if two (or more) vectors are involved, how to add or multiply vectors to get resultant output vector?
 5. What if the axes are transformed linearly, rotated/shifted/oriented ( as if sheet of paper can be transformed or oriented in n ways     in space)?
 6. How to represent a new transformed system with known old system and tranformation matrix (orientation)?
 7. How does the orientation / transformation has an impact the system?
 8. By how much scale the resultant be oriented after transformation?
 9. What do the Span of tranformated vectors be?  
 10.What is area under the vectors constitue to? 
 11.How can we define system behaviour based on determinant? 
 
 the answers being:
 
 1. How the vectors are presented in space? -- MATRIX of its position relative to X,Y(/Z...) co-ordinate system
 2. What is the basis of a co-ordinate system for ref? -- a basis i,j 2D co-ordinate system or i,j,k 3D co-ordinate system and so on
 3. What it means to scalar multiply a Vector, its behaviour? -- results again a vector in space. its behaviour depending on +ve or -ve     scale . Its Linear( scale) Algebra
 4. What if two (or more) vectors are involved, how to add or multiply vectors to get resultant output vector? - Matrix multiplication       and Addition
 5. What if the axes are transformed linearly, rotated/shifted/oriented ( as if sheet of paper can be transformed or oriented in n ways     in space)? - Linear Transformation, Shear
 6. How to represent a new transformed system with known old system and tranformation matrix (orientation)? -- Linear Transformation     
    matrix times Parameter(s) matrix
 7. How does the orientation / transformation has an impact the system? -- Column Space, Null space, Rank, Span of vector after 
    transformation
 8. By how much scale the resultant be oriented after transformation? -- its the Eigen value of the vector
 9. What do the Span of tranformated vectors be? -- these are Eigen Vectors, the special vectors which maintain same span even after  
    transformation
 10.What is area under the vectors constitue to? -- its the determinant of the resultant vector
 11.How can we define system behaviour based on determinant? -- if det(A) = 0 => no area covered between vectors=> vectors are on same  
    axis=> vectors are linearly spaced => the resultant effect on system will be a linear behaviour.
