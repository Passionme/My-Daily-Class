A Convolution is a subset vector(/tensor of m1Xn1) which can be used as a multipler over the input vector (of size mXn) to identify a pattern in the input image vector.

The resultant (we get a tensor) of the production of Convolution (array) and input (array) is called a channel.

The convolution can be used to detect a pattern -> a vertical line or a horizaontal line or a pattern in array form to identif strokes in the input image.

This convolution is also called filter. 

Applying many such convolutions will yield n-Convolution outputs or n-Filters -> consititues a Convolution layer and each filter result termed as "channel" in Convolution layer.

Idea behind the mutli channels (=tensor) in Convolution layer is to identif different aspects/artifacts of the input image.

A first filter may be the convolution over input image = result1, say
While rest filters can be convolution over the result1 and so on
