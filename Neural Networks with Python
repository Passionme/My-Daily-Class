# What is Neural Network?

Neural Network is a Data Transformer. It converts one form of Data in to another.
If you are familiar with the term "Transfer Function", NN can be easily understood as a Tansfer Function.

#What is Training Neural Network? Why is it required?

In simple terms, Training NN is Calbrating the NN parameters( weights)
As we adjust the gain, proportional, intergral factors for better performance of a system defined by its TF (Tansfer Function), 
so we adjust the weights of the NN for fine tuning the output.
