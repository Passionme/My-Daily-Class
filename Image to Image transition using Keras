# Keras - A collection of AI algos in API 

Greek word κέρας (Keras) means "horn". Well, here I'm, the Oneiros, to tell the furture of my project IMAGE to IMAGE transition through the gate of κέρας.

The main idea to start Keras for Image to Image transition (Night to Day) was to learn Keras.

While the same task could have been achieved by simple logic in Opencv, by averaging the pixels to find Night/Day, I found the Keras giving more access to algorithms. I used Keras to implement CycleGAN containing both the Generator NN to learn and the Descriminator NN to learn vice-versa of Generator NN (unlearn what was learnt in GNNto reproduce original image).


Well, that answers WHY KERAS?
For my understanding, I would like to list the algos available in Keras as rest can be achieved with any other APIs available in the market.
